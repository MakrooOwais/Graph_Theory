# Graph Theory Algorithms in Python and JavaScript

This GitHub repository contains implementations of various graph theory algorithms in both Python and JavaScript. Graph theory is a fundamental area of computer science that deals with the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures representing a set of objects and the connections between them. These algorithms are essential for solving a wide range of real-world problems, such as finding the shortest path in a network, detecting cycles, and performing graph traversals.

## Introduction to Graphs and Networks

Graphs are mathematical structures that consist of a set of vertices (nodes) and a set of edges (connections) between these vertices. They are used to model relationships between different objects, where the vertices represent the objects, and the edges represent the connections or interactions between them. Graphs are widely used in various fields, including computer science, social sciences, transportation, and communication networks.

A graph can be represented visually using nodes (vertices) and lines (edges) connecting these nodes. Depending on the presence or absence of direction and weight, graphs can be categorized into different types:

- **Undirected Graph**: In an undirected graph, the edges have no direction, and the connection between two vertices is bidirectional. If there is an edge between vertex A and vertex B, it implies that there is also an edge between vertex B and vertex A.

- **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: In a directed graph, the edges have a specific direction from one vertex to another. The connection between two vertices is unidirectional. If there is a directed edge from vertex A to vertex B, it does not necessarily imply a directed edge from vertex B to vertex A.

- **Weighted Graph**: In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a numerical value called a weight. The weight represents a cost or distance associated with traversing the edge.

- **Cyclic Graph**: A graph that contains at least one cycle, i.e., a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, is called a cyclic graph.

- **Acyclic Graph**: A graph that does not contain any cycles is called an acyclic graph.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a specific folder structure to organize the implementations of different graph theory algorithms:

1. **main.py**: This file contains the Python implementation of a specific graph theory algorithm. Each algorithm has its own folder containing its corresponding `main.py` file.

2. **main.js**: This file contains the JavaScript implementation of the same graph theory algorithm. Each algorithm has its own folder containing its corresponding `main.js` file.

The folder structure is designed to make it easy for developers to locate and explore the implementations of individual graph theory algorithms in both Python and JavaScript.

## Algorithms Included

The repository currently includes the following graph theory algorithms:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

- Strongly Connected Components (SCC)

Each algorithm has its own folder containing the `main.py` and `main.js` files for the Python and JavaScript implementations, respectively.
