# Capacity Scaling Algorithm - Explanation and Implementation

The provided code implements the **Capacity Scaling algorithm** for solving the maximum flow problem in a flow network. Let's understand the concept of capacity scaling, the algorithm itself, and how the implementation works.

## Capacity Scaling Concept

The Capacity Scaling algorithm is a variation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, which aims to improve the efficiency of finding augmenting paths by considering only paths with capacities greater than or equal to a certain threshold (delta). Initially, delta is set to a value greater than or equal to the maximum edge capacity in the network. In each iteration, delta is halved. This approach allows the algorithm to eliminate augmenting paths with very small capacities, leading to fewer iterations and faster convergence.

## Implementation Explanation

The provided code contains the following components:

- **Graph Class (`graph`)**: An instance of the custom `Graph` class that contains edges and their capacities.

- **`dfs` Function**: A depth-first search function that searches for augmenting paths within the current delta. It returns the bottleneck capacity of the found path.

- **`capacityScaling` Function**: The main algorithm function. It initializes delta to a value greater than or equal to the maximum edge capacity and iterates through delta reductions until delta becomes zero. In each iteration, it performs multiple DFS searches for augmenting paths and augments the flow accordingly.

## Key Steps of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Set delta to be the maximum edge capacity in the graph.

2. **Main Loop**: Iterate while delta is greater than zero.

3. **DFS Iterations**: Perform multiple DFS searches using the `dfs` function. This searches for augmenting paths with capacities greater than or equal to delta. If a path is found, augment the flow and update the residual capacities.

4. **Delta Halving**: Halve the value of delta in each iteration.

5. **Termination**: The algorithm terminates when delta becomes zero.

## Example Usage

The provided example creates a flow network using the `Graph` class and adds edges with capacities. Then, the `capacityScaling` function is called on this network to find the maximum flow.

## Advantages of Capacity Scaling

- **Efficiency**: Capacity Scaling efficiently eliminates small-capacity augmenting paths, reducing the number of iterations required for convergence.

- **Faster Convergence**: The algorithm converges faster compared to traditional Ford-Fulkerson methods.

## Conclusion

The Capacity Scaling algorithm is a smart modification of the Ford-Fulkerson method for solving the maximum flow problem. By iteratively considering augmenting paths with capacities greater than or equal to a threshold (delta), the algorithm efficiently converges to the maximum flow value. The provided implementation showcases the algorithm's core logic and demonstrates how it can be applied to solve maximum flow problems with improved efficiency.
